# mbedSnake
a Snake clone for use for use with the ARM mbed and C12832 screen on the Application Board

The purpose of this project was to apply fundamental C techniques into practice and to produce a system where the user interacts with the screen, as opposed to with a command line.

Sprites of Snake were obtained from the Snake II edition included in early Nokia phones, such as the 3310.
